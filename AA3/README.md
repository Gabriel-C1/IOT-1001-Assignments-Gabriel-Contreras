# AA3 – Bill Tip & Split Calculator (C#)

This program calculates the tip amount and total bill based on user input.  
It also allows splitting the bill between multiple people.

## Added Features for Applied Activity 6 (Q2)

- It automatically creates one `.txt` file per person.
- Each file contains:
  - The person's name
  - The total bill
  - The split amount

Example output files included (e.g., `Alice.txt`, `Bob.txt`).

## How to Run

2. Run the program.
3. Enter the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people.
4. Enter the names to generate the invoice files.
